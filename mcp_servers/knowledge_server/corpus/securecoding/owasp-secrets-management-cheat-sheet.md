## 1 Introduction

Secrets are being used everywhere nowadays, especially with the popularity of the DevOps movement. Application Programming Interface (API) keys, database credentials, Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions, Secure Shell (SSH) keys, certificates, etc. Many organizations have them hardcoded within the source code in plaintext, littered throughout configuration files and configuration management tools.

There is a growing need for organizations to centralize the storage, provisioning, auditing, rotation and management of secrets to control access to secrets and prevent them from leaking and compromising the organization. Often, services share the same secrets, which makes identifying the source of compromise or leak challenging.

This cheat sheet offers best practices and guidelines to help properly implement secrets management.

## 2 General Secrets Management

The following sections address the main concepts relating to secrets management.

## 2.4.1 Architectural Patterns for Automated Rotation

To illustrate how to design systems that support automated secret rotation, here are a few architectural patterns:

##### Example 1: Kubernetes with a Sidecar Container

In a Kubernetes environment, a common pattern is to use a sidecar container that is responsible for retrieving secrets from a secrets manager and making them available to the main application container. This decouples the application from the specifics of the secrets management solution.

- **Architecture:**
    - A Pod contains two containers: the main application container and a sidecar container (e.g., HashiCorp Vault Agent, CyberArk Conjur Secrets Provider).
    - The sidecar container authenticates with the secrets manager (e.g., using a Kubernetes Service Account).
    - It retrieves the secret and writes it to a shared in-memory volume.
    - The application container reads the secret from the shared volume.
    - The sidecar container can periodically refresh the secret, ensuring the application always has a valid, short-lived credential.
- **Kubernetes Manifest Snippet:**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-app
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: my-app-sa
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app-image
        volumeMounts:
        - name: secrets-volume
          mountPath: "/mnt/secrets"
          readOnly: true
      - name: vault-agent-sidecar
        image: vault:latest
        args: ["agent", "-config=/etc/vault/vault-agent-config.hcl"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: secrets-volume
          mountPath: "/mnt/secrets"
      volumes:
      - name: secrets-volume
        emptyDir:
          medium: "Memory"
    ```

##### Example 2: Serverless Function for Database Credential Rotation

Cloud-native secret managers often provide built-in support for automated rotation using serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).

- **Architecture:**
    - A secret is stored in a cloud secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).
    - The secrets manager is configured to trigger a rotation Lambda function on a schedule.
    - The Lambda function has the necessary permissions to update the database password and the secret value in the secrets manager.
    - The rotation process typically involves multiple steps (create new secret, set new secret, test new secret, finish rotation) to ensure a safe transition.

For AWS, start from the [rotation function templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_available-rotation-templates.html). Secrets Manager invokes the function [separately for each rotation step](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_lambda.html); retrieve the pending credential from the secret version identified by `ClientRequestToken`, rather than relying on a local variable from an earlier invocation.

Follow the [rotation function security checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_lambda-functions.html) and [template validation](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-secrets-manager-rotation-lambdas/blob/master/SecretsManagerRotationTemplate/lambda_function.py): ensure rotation is enabled and the request token identifies a known secret version. Safely return if that version is already `AWSCURRENT`; otherwise, require `AWSPENDING`. Before changing credentials, validate the current credential and confirm that the pending version targets the intended database and user under the chosen rotation strategy. These checks prevent the privileged function from being redirected to another resource. Test the pending credential before promoting its version to `AWSCURRENT`.

These examples demonstrate how you can create architectures that not only manage secrets securely but also automate the rotation process, significantly reducing the risk of compromised credentials.

## 2.5 Handling Secrets in Memory

An additional level of security can be achieved by minimizing the time window
where a secret is in memory and limiting the access to its memory space.

Depending on your application's particular circumstances, this can be difficult
to implement in a manner that ensures memory security. Because of this potential
implementation complexity, you are first encouraged to develop a threat model in order to clearly
surface your implicit assumptions about both your application's deployment environment as well
as understand the capabilities of your adversaries.

Often attempting to protect secrets in memory will be considered overkill
because as you evaluate a threat model, the potential threat
actors that you consider either do not have the capabilities to carry out such attacks
or the cost of defense far exceeds the likely impact of a compromise arising from
exposing secrets in memory. Also, it should be kept in mind while developing an
appropriate threat model, that if an attacker already has access to the memory of
the process handling the secret, by that time a security breach may have already
occurred. Furthermore, it should be recognized that with the advent of attacks like
[Rowhammer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07613.pdf), or
[Meltdown and Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com/), it is important
to understand that the operating system alone is not sufficient to protect your process
memory from these types of attacks. This becomes especially important when your
application is deployed to the cloud. The only foolproof approach to protecting memory
against these and similar attacks is to fully physically isolate your process memory from all other
untrusted processes.

Despite the implementation difficulties, in highly sensitive
environments, protecting secrets in memory can
be a valuable additional layer of security. For example, in scenarios where an
advanced attacker can cause a system to crash and gain access to a memory dump,
they may be able to extract secrets from it. Therefore, carefully safeguarding
secrets in memory is recommended for untrusted environments or situations where
tight security is of utmost importance.

Furthermore, in lower-level languages like C/C++, it is relatively easy to protect
secrets in memory. Thus, it may be worthwhile to implement this practice even if
the risk of an attacker gaining access to the memory is low. On the other hand, for
programming languages that rely on garbage collection, securing secrets in memory
generally is much more difficult.

- **Structures and Classes:** In .NET and Java, do not use immutable structures
    such as Strings to store secrets, since it is impossible to force them to
    be garbage collected. Instead, use primitive types such as byte arrays or
    char arrays, where the memory can be directly overwritten.

- **Zeroing Memory:** After a secret has been used, the memory it occupied
  should be zeroed out to prevent it from lingering in memory where it could
  potentially be accessed.

- **Memory Encryption:** In some cases, it may be possible to use hardware or
  operating system features to encrypt the entire memory space of the process
  handling the secret. This can provide an additional layer of security.

Remember, the goal is to minimize the time window where the secret is in
plaintext in memory as much as possible.

from the OWASP MAS project.

## 3 Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)

Building, testing and deploying changes generally requires access to many systems. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) tools typically store secrets to provide configuration to the application or during deployment. Alternatively, they interact heavily with the secrets management system. Various best practices can help smooth out secret management in CI/CD; we will deal with some of them in this section.

## 3.1 Hardening your CI/CD pipeline

CI/CD tooling consumes (high-privilege) credentials regularly. Ensure that the pipeline cannot be easily hacked or misused by employees. Here are a few guidelines which can help you:

- Treat your CI/CD tooling as a production environment: harden it, patch it and harden the underlying infrastructure and services.
- Have Security Event Monitoring in place.
- Implement least-privilege access: developers do not need to be able to administer projects. Instead, they only need to be able to execute required functions, such as setting up pipelines, running them, and working with code. Administrative tasks can quickly be done using configuration-as-code in a separate repository used by the CI/CD system to update its configuration. There is no need for privileged roles that might have access to secrets.
- Make sure that pipeline output does not leak secrets, and you can't listen in on production pipelines with debugging tools.
- Make sure you cannot exec into any runners and workers for a CI/CD system.
- Have proper authentication, authorization and accounting in place.
- Ensure only an approved process can create pipelines, including MR/PR steps to ensure that a created pipeline is security-reviewed.

## 3.2 Where should a secret be?

There are various places where you can store a secret to execute CI/CD actions:

- As part of your CI/CD tooling: you can store a secret in [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/secrets.html)/[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)/[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/security/secrets/). This is not the same as committing it to code.
- As part of your secrets-management system: you can store a secret in a secrets management system, such as facilities provided by a cloud provider ([AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts), [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)), or other third-party facilities ([Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Conjur](https://www.conjur.org/), [Keeper](https://www.keepersecurity.com/)). In this case, the CI/CD pipeline tooling requires credentials to connect to these secret management systems to have secrets in place. See [Cloud Providers](#4-cloud-providers) for more details on using a cloud provider's secret management system.

Another alternative here is using the CI/CD pipeline to leverage the Encryption as a Service from the secrets management systems to do the encryption of a secret. The CI/CD tooling can then commit the encrypted secret to git, which can be fetched by the consuming service on deployment and decrypted again. See section 3.6 for more details.

Note: not all secrets must be in the CI/CD pipeline to get to the actual deployment. Instead, make sure that the deployed services take care of part of their secrets management at their own lifecycle (e.g., deployment, runtime and destruction).

## 3.2.2 Storing it in a secrets management system

Naturally, you can store secrets in a designated secrets management solution. For example, you can use a solution offered by your (cloud) infrastructure provider, such as [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), [Google Secrets Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager), or [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts). You can find more information about these in [section 4](#4-cloud-providers) of this cheat sheet. Another option is a dedicated secrets management system, such as [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Keeper](https://www.keepersecurity.com/), [Conjur](https://www.conjur.org/).
Here are a few do's and don'ts for the CI/CD interaction with these systems. Make sure that the following is taken care of:

- Rotation/Temporality: credentials used by the CI/CD tooling to authenticate against the secret management system are rotated frequently and expire after a job completes.
- Scope of authorization: scope credentials used by the CI/CD tooling (e.g., roles, users, etc.), only authorize those secrets and services of the secret management system required for the CI/CD tooling to execute its job.
- Attribution of the caller: credentials used by the CI/CD tooling still hold attribution of the one calling the secrets management solution. Ensure you can attribute any calls made by the CI/CD tooling to a person or service that requested the actions of the CI/CD tooling. If this is not possible through the default configuration of the secrets manager, make sure that you have a correlation setup in terms of request parameters.
- All of the above: Still follow those do's and don'ts listed in section 3.2.1: log & alert, take care of forking, etc.
- Backup: back up secrets to product-critical operations in separate storage (e.g., cold storage), especially encryption keys.

## 3.6 Pipeline Created Secrets

You can use pipeline tooling to generate secrets and either offer them directly to the service deployed by the tooling or provide the secret to a secrets management solution. Alternatively, the secret can be stored encrypted in git so that the secret and its metadata is as close to the developer's daily place of work as possible. A git-stored secret does require that developers cannot decrypt the secrets themselves and that every consumer of a secret has its encrypted variant of the secret. For instance: the secret should then be different per DTAP environment and be encrypted with another key. For each environment, only the designated consumer in that environment should be able to decrypt the specific secret. A secret does not leak cross-environment and can still be easily stored next to the code.
Consumers of a secret could now decrypt the secret using a sidecar, as described in section 5.2. Instead of retrieving the secrets, the consumer would leverage the sidecar to decrypt the secret.

When a pipeline creates a secret by itself, ensure that the scripts or binaries involved adhere to best practices for secret generation. Best practices include secure randomness, proper length of secret creation, etc. and that the secret is created based on well-defined metadata stored somewhere in git or somewhere else.

## 4.1 Services to Use

It is best to use a designated secret management solution in any environment. Most cloud providers have at least one service that offers secret management. Of course, it's also possible to run a different secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or Conjur) on compute resources within the cloud. We'll consider cloud provider service offerings in this section.

Sometimes it's possible to automatically rotate your secret, either via a service provided by your cloud provider or a (custom-built) function. Generally, you should prefer the cloud provider's solution since the barrier of entry and risk of misconfiguration are lower. If you use a custom solution, ensure the function's role to do its rotation can only be assumed by said function.

## 4.1.1 AWS

For AWS, the recommended solution is [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html).

Permissions are granted at the secret level. Check out the [Secrets Manager best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/best-practices.html).

It is also possible to use the [Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html), which is cheaper, but that has a few downsides:

- you'll need to make sure you've specified encryption yourself (secrets manager does that by default)
- it offers fewer auto-rotation capabilities (you will likely need to build a custom function)
- cross-account sharing is limited to [advanced parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-shared-parameters.html); sharing encrypted `SecureString` values also requires a customer managed AWS KMS key and separately granting access to that key
- it doesn't support cross-region replication
- there are fewer [Security Hub Controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html) available

##### 4.1.1.1 AWS Nitro Enclaves

With [AWS Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/), you can create isolated compute environments to further protect and securely process highly sensitive data such as secrets. Enclaves are hardened, and restrict operator access, providing a trusted execution environment. A key feature is cryptographic attestation, which allows you to verify the enclave's identity and ensure only authorized code is running before provisioning secrets to it. This makes it a strong choice for scenarios requiring high assurance in secret handling.

##### 4.1.1.2 AWS CloudHSM

For secrets being used in highly confidential applications, it may be needed to have more control over the encryption and storage of these keys. AWS offers [CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/), which lets you bring your own key (BYOK) for AWS services. Thus, you will have more control over keys' creation, lifecycle, and durability. Scale a CloudHSM cluster by [adding or removing HSMs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/add-remove-hsm.html); the service makes [periodic encrypted backups of cluster users, keys, and configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/manage-backups.html). The cloud service provider, Amazon, will not have any access to the key material stored in **AWS CloudHSM**.

## 4.1.3 Azure

For Azure, the recommended service is [Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/).

Azure's [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide) supports role assignments for individual secrets, keys, and certificates. Follow the [Identity and Access Management guidance](#43-identity-and-access-management-iam) for access scopes and vault boundaries.

Check out the [Key Vault best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/best-practices).

##### 4.1.3.1 Azure Confidential Computing

With [Azure Confidential Computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/#overview), you can create trusted execution environments. This technology isolates sensitive data within a protected container, ensuring that it is encrypted both at rest, in transit, and in use. Services like **Azure Confidential Virtual Machines** and **Confidential Containers on ACI** utilize technologies like Intel SGX and AMD SEV-SNP to create these secure enclaves. This prevents unauthorized access from cloud administrators, malware, or other tenants, making it a robust solution for secret management.

##### 4.1.3.2 Azure Dedicated HSM

For secrets being used in Azure environments and requiring special security considerations, Azure offers [Azure Dedicated HSM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-dedicated-hsm/). This allows you more control over the secrets stored on it, including enhanced administrative and cryptographic control. The cloud service provider, Microsoft, will not have any access to the key material stored in Azure Dedicated HSM.

## 4.2.2 Bring Your Own Key versus Cloud Provider Key

When you encrypt a secret at rest, the question is: which key do you want to use? The less trust you have in the cloud provider, the more you will want to manage yourself.

Often, you can either encrypt a secret with a key managed at the secrets management service or use a key management solution from the cloud provider to encrypt the secret. The key offered through the key management solution of the cloud provider can be either managed by the cloud provider or by yourself. Industry standards call the latter "bring your own key" (BYOK). You can either directly import or generate this key at the key management solution or using cloud HSM supported by the cloud provider.
You can then either use your key or the customer main key from the provider to encrypt the data key of the secrets management solution. The data key, in turn, encrypts the secret. By managing the CMK, you have control over the data key at the secrets management solution.

While importing your own key material can generally be done with all providers ([AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html), [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/keys/byok-specification), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/key-import)), unless you know what you are doing and your threat model and policy require this, this is not a recommended solution due to its complexity and difficulty of use.

## 4.3 Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM applies to both on-premises and cloud setups: to effectively manage secrets, you need to set up suitable access policies and roles. Setting this up goes beyond policies regarding secrets; it should include hardening the full IAM setup, as it could otherwise allow for privilege escalation attacks. Ensure you never allow open "pass role" privileges or unrestricted IAM creation privileges, as these can use or create credentials that have access to the secrets. Next, make sure you tightly control what can impersonate a service account: are your machines' roles accessible by an attacker exploiting your server? Can service roles from the data-pipeline tooling access the secrets easily? Ensure you include IAM for every cloud component in your threat model (e.g., ask yourself: how can you do elevation of privileges with this component?). See [this blog entry](https://xebia.com/ten-pitfalls-you-should-look-out-for-in-aws-iam/) for multiple do's and don'ts with examples.

Leverage the temporality of the IAM principals effectively: e.g., ensure that only specific roles and service accounts that require it can access the secrets. Monitor these accounts so that you can tell who or what used them to access the secrets.

Next, make sure that you scope access to your secrets: one should not be simply allowed to access all secrets. In GCP and AWS, you can create fine-grained access policies to ensure that a principal cannot access all secrets at once. For Azure Key Vault, use the recommended [Azure RBAC permission model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide) with least-privilege roles. Azure RBAC supports role assignments at the scope of individual keys, secrets, and certificates for limited sharing scenarios, but Microsoft recommends [separate vaults per application and environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/secure-key-vault) as the primary security boundary.

## 4.4 API limits

Cloud services can generally provide a limited amount of API calls over a given period. You could potentially (D)DoS yourself when you run into these limits. Most of these limits apply per account, project, or subscription, so spread workloads to limit your blast radius accordingly. Additionally, some services may support data key caching, preventing load on the key management service API (see, for example, [AWS data key caching](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/data-key-caching.html)). Some services can leverage built-in data key caching. [S3 is one such example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-key.html).

## 5.1 Injection of Secrets (file, in-memory)

There are three ways to get secrets to an app inside a Docker container.

- Mounted volumes (file): With this method, we keep our secrets within a particular config/secret file and mount that file to our instance as a mounted volume. Ensure that these mounts are mounted in by the orchestrator and never built-in, as this will leak the secret with the container definition. Instead, make sure that the orchestrator mounts in the volume when required.
- Fetch from the secret store (in-memory): A sidecar app/container fetches the secrets it needs directly from a secret manager service without dealing with docker config. This solution allows you to use dynamically constructed secrets without worrying about the secrets being viewable from the file system or from checking the Docker container's environment variables.
- Environment variables: We can provide secrets directly as part of the Docker container configuration. Note: secrets themselves should never be hardcoded using docker ENV or docker ARG commands, as these can easily leak with the container definitions. See the Docker challenges at [WrongSecrets](https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets) as well. Instead, let an orchestrator overwrite the environment variable with the actual secret and ensure that this is not hardcoded. Additionally, environment variables are generally accessible to all processes and may be included in logs or system dumps. Using environment variables is therefore not recommended unless the other methods are not possible.

## 5.2 Short-Lived Sidecar Containers

To inject secrets, you could create short-lived sidecar containers that fetch secrets from some remote endpoint and then store them on a shared volume mounted to the original container. The original container can now use the secrets from the mounted volume. The benefit of using this approach is that we don't need to integrate any third-party tool or code to get secrets. Once the sidecar has fetched the secrets, it terminates. Examples of this include [Vault Agent Sidecar Injector](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector) and [Conjur Secrets Provider](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s). By mounting secrets to a volume shared with the pod, containers within the pod can consume secrets without being aware of the secrets manager.

## 6.5 Usability and Ease of Onboarding

For a secrets management solution to be effective, it must be easy for developers to adopt and use. If the process is too complex, developers may resort to insecure practices. A focus on usability and a smooth onboarding experience is critical.

- **Clear and Comprehensive Documentation:**
    - Provide clear, concise, and easy-to-find documentation. This should include tutorials for common use cases, detailed API references, and practical examples.
    - Maintain a "getting started" guide that walks new users through the process of obtaining their first secret.
- **Developer-Friendly Tooling and SDKs:**
    - Offer well-maintained SDKs for various programming languages to simplify integration.
    - Provide a command-line interface (CLI) that allows developers to manage secrets from their local development environment.
    - Develop plugins for common IDEs, CI/CD systems, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Pulumi.
- **Streamlined Workflows:**
    - Implement self-service workflows that enable developers to request and receive secrets with minimal manual intervention.
    - Use GitOps principles to manage secrets as code, allowing developers to define secret needs in a declarative manner alongside their application code.
    - Automate the approval process for low-risk secrets while maintaining appropriate controls for more sensitive ones.
- **Actionable Feedback and Support:**
    - Provide clear error messages that help developers troubleshoot issues independently.
    - Establish dedicated support channels (e.g., a Slack channel, a ticketing system) where developers can get help from the security or platform team.
- **Easy Integration:**
    - Ensure the secrets management solution can be easily integrated with existing applications. Sidecar containers, such as the [Vault Agent Sidecar Injector](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector) or the [Conjur Secrets Provider](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s), can help decouple applications from the secrets management system.

## 8.1 General detection approaches

Shift-left and DevSecOps principles apply to secrets detection as well. These general approaches below aim to consider secrets earlier and evolve the practice over time.

- Create standard test secrets and use them universally across the organization. This allows for reducing false positives by only needing to track a single test secret for each secret type.
- Consider enabling secrets detection at the developer level to avoid checking secrets into code before commit/PR either in the IDE, as part of test-driven development, or via pre-commit hook.
- Make secrets detection part of the threat model. Consider secrets as part of the attack surface during threat modeling exercises.
- Evaluate detection utilities and related signatures often to ensure they meet expectations.
- Consider having more than one detection utility and correlating/de-duping results to identify potential areas of detection weakness.
- Explore a balance between entropy and ease of detection. Secrets with consistent formats are easier to detect with lower false-positive rates, but you also don't want to miss a human-created password simply because it doesn't match your detection rules.

## 9.2 Remediation

The primary goal of incident response is rapid response and containment.

Containment should follow these procedures:

1. Revocation: Keys that were exposed should undergo immediate revocation. The secret must be able to be de-authorized quickly, and systems must be in place to identify the revocation status.
2. Rotation: A new secret must be able to be quickly created and implemented, preferably via an automated process to ensure repeatability, low rate of implementation error, and least-privilege (not directly human-readable).
3. Deletion: Secrets revoked/rotated must be removed from the exposed system immediately, including secrets discovered in code or logs. Secrets in code could have commit history for the exposure squashed to before the introduction of the secret, however, this may introduce other problems as it rewrites git history and will break any other links to a given commit. If you decide to do this be aware of the consequences and plan accordingly. Secrets in logs must have a process for removing the secret while maintaining log integrity.
4. Logging: Incident response teams must have access to information about the lifecycle of a secret to aid in containment and remediation, including:
    - Who had access?
    - When did they use it?
    - When was it previously rotated?

## 10.1 Introduction

Managing secrets in a multi-cloud environment presents unique challenges due to the diversity of cloud providers and their respective services. This section discusses the challenges and best practices for managing secrets across multiple cloud providers.

## 10.2 Challenges

1. **Diverse APIs and Interfaces**: Each cloud provider has its own API and interface for managing secrets, which can lead to complexity in integrating and managing secrets across multiple providers.
2. **Inconsistent Security Policies**: Different cloud providers may have varying security policies and practices, making it challenging to enforce consistent security standards across all environments.
3. **Key Rotation**: Ensuring that keys are rotated consistently and securely across multiple cloud providers can be difficult, especially if each provider has different mechanisms for key rotation.
4. **Access Control**: Managing access control for secrets across multiple cloud providers can be complex, as each provider may have different access control mechanisms and policies.
5. **Auditing and Monitoring**: Ensuring comprehensive auditing and monitoring of secret access and usage across multiple cloud providers can be challenging due to the differences in logging and monitoring capabilities.

## 10.3 Best Practices

1. **Use a Centralized Secrets Management Solution**: Implement a centralized secrets management solution that can integrate with multiple cloud providers. This can help standardize the management of secrets and enforce consistent security policies across all environments. Examples include HashiCorp Vault and CyberArk Conjur.
2. **Standardize Security Policies**: Define and enforce standardized security policies for managing secrets across all cloud providers. This includes policies for key rotation, access control, and auditing.
3. **Automate Key Rotation**: Implement automated key rotation processes to ensure that keys are rotated consistently and securely across all cloud providers. Use tools and scripts to automate the rotation process and reduce the risk of human error.
4. **Implement Fine-Grained Access Control**: Use fine-grained access control mechanisms to restrict access to secrets based on the principle of least privilege. Ensure that access control policies are consistently enforced across all cloud providers.
5. **Enable Comprehensive Auditing and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive auditing and monitoring of secret access and usage across all cloud providers. Use centralized logging and monitoring solutions to aggregate and analyze logs from multiple providers.
